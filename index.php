                <h3>About this site</h3>
                <p>This is my online website for my Transformer toy collection! 
                    I made this as a way of combining two of my passions in life:
                    programming and collecting Transformer toys! I figured, 
                    "Hey, why not make an online list of my collection I can 
                    reference on the go?" After all, sometimes I'm at the store 
                    and just can't remember what I have off the top of my head 
                    in my collection. And its a great way to put my skills from 
                    my degree to good use while gaining a nice portfolio piece.

                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p>The site is pretty simple: there are two lists of toys, those
                    that I own, and those that I don't and I want to collect. 
                    These two lists have options to sort the Transformers by size 
                    and toyline. There is also a search function to lookup a toy
                    incase I can't remember if I bought it or not. Its a nice 
                    little feature that helps me find what I want quick and easy, 
                    because sometime I will forget that I've already got a 
                    particular Transformer (I once bought two of the same one by
                    mistake!)
                </p>
                <h3>Future Development</h3>
                <p>I have some more ideas of functionality for the website, but 
                    at the moment I'm not sure if I want to implement them or if
                    they're too advanced for use for a simple site like this.</p>
